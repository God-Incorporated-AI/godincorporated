# God Incorporated

God Incorporated is an experimental AI-powered oracle platform built with FastAPI.  
It explores inquiry, wisdom, voice interaction, and value-for-value participation through a modular and extensible backend.

This repository contains the backend service that powers the oracle experience, including:
- Text-based oracle queries
- Voice input and speech output
- Session and visitor tracking
- Scroll (knowledge) ingestion
- Modular oracle routing (e.g., Hathor, Moses)
- Future support for influence, attribution, and value-for-value interaction

The system is designed to evolve gradually, prioritizing clarity, stability, and experiential integrity over rapid feature expansion.
